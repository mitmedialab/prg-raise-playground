 * to a maximum capacity. Each task "costs" a certain number of tokens; if insufficient tokens are available, the task
 * must wait until enough tokens have accumulated.
 * In addition, a concurrency limit controls how many tasks can be run simultaneously. If the concurrency limit is
 * reached, additional tasks must wait until a running task completes even if there are enough tokens available.
 * @see {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket} for more information about the algorithm.
