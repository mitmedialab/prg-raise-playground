In particular, for saving to Google Drive, you can connect your Google account to the website. Your use of that account is subject to Google’s Terms of Service for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy. MIT has no access to your Google account or the information you provide for it. In the future, the MIT Personal Robots Group may provide alternative means for using MIT AI Blocks without third-party personal storage websites, at which point we will update these terms of use to reflect those alternatives.</p>
