# Extensions

This document aims to complement the information provided in the [root README.md](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/README.md) (especially the [extensions section](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/README.md#-how-to-program-an-extension)).

Here we drill down more into the development details associated with extensions. 

This document will be most helpful for people doing more complex development, like:
- Adding UI to extensions
- Writing tests for extensions 
- Porting vanilla Javascript extensions to the use the newer Typescript Extension Framework
- Working on the Typescript Extension Framework itself

## Anatomy of an Extension Directory

Extensions are defined by all the files that appear in their associated directory, located within `/extensions/src/`.

This directory is created when you run the command `npm run new:extension <extension name>` from the root of the project, where the value you provide for `<extension name>` is used to name this new directory. 

> **NOTE:** It is important to keep in mind that the name of an extension's associated directory is internally used to identify it, so it is best to avoid changing the directory's name (as this could affect previously saved `.sb3` projects that reference the extension).

### Included Files

Below are the files you should always find within an extension's directory:

- `index.ts`
    - This is the main place where your extension is implemented. It is **expected** that your extension class will be the `default export` of this file. For example:
```ts 
export default class ExampleExtension extends Extension<...> {
    ...
}
```
- `index.test.ts`
    - This is where you can implement both `unit` and `integration` tests for your extension.
    - Hop down to [Testing Extension](#testing-extensions) for more info.
- `package.json`
    - Each extension is treated as it's own package and thus has it's own [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) file. 
        - This makes it easy to handle cases when two extensions want to use different versions of the same [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/). 

### Auxiliary Files

In adition to the above files, you might find any of the below: 

- `.png` or `.jpg` files
    - Image files included in an extension directory are likely either used for icons and/or tutorials.
- `.svelte` files
    - Extensions can have their own associated UI windows, which are implemented using the [Svelte Frontend Framework](https://svelte.dev/).
    - Hop down to [Creating UI for Extensions](#creating-ui-for-extensions) for more info.
- `translations.ts`
    - In the future, this file will be used to support defining an extension's display text in mulitple languages.
    - Currently **NOT** used.
- Additional `.ts` files
    - Developers are free to create as many typescript files as they need within their extensions's directory -- and frankly it's encouraged! Long files can be difficult to read. 
- `README.md`
    - Motivated developers might include a README file to help document their extension.
