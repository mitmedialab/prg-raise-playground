# Extensions

This document aims to complement the information provided in the [root README.md](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/README.md) (especially the [extensions section](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/README.md#-how-to-program-an-extension)).

Here we drill down more into the development details associated with extensions. 

This document will be most helpful for people doing more complex development, like:
- Adding UI to extensions
- Writing tests for extensions 
- Porting vanilla Javascript extensions to the use the newer Typescript Extension Framework
- Working on the Typescript Extension Framework itself

## Anatomy of an Extension Directory

Extensions are defined by all the files that appear in their associated directory, located within `/extensions/src/`.

This directory is created when you run the command `npm run new:extension <extension name>` from the root of the project, where the value you provide for `<extension name>` is used to name this new directory. 

> **NOTE:** It is important to keep in mind that the name of an extension's associated directory is internally used to identify it, so it is best to avoid changing the directory's name (as this could affect previously saved `.sb3` projects that reference the extension).

### Included Files

Below are the files you should always find within an extension's directory:

- `index.ts`
    - This is the main place where your extension is implemented. It is **expected** that your extension class will be the `default export` of this file. For example:
```ts 
export default class ExampleExtension extends Extension<...> {
    ...
}
```
- `index.test.ts`
    - This is where you can implement both `unit` and `integration` tests for your extension.
    - Hop down to [Testing Extension](#testing-extensions) for more info.
- `package.json`
    - Each extension is treated as it's own package and thus has it's own [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) file. 
        - This makes it easy to handle cases when two extensions want to use different versions of the same [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/). 

### Auxiliary Files

In adition to the above files, you might find any of the below: 

- `.png` or `.jpg` files
    - Image files included in an extension directory are likely either used for icons and/or tutorials.
- `.svelte` files
    - Extensions can have their own associated UI windows, which are implemented using the [Svelte Frontend Framework](https://svelte.dev/).
    - Hop down to [Creating UI for Extensions](#creating-ui-for-extensions) for more info.
- `translations.ts`
    - In the future, this file will be used to support defining an extension's display text in mulitple languages.
    - Currently **NOT** used.
- Additional `.ts` files
    - Developers are free to create as many typescript files as they need within their extensions's directory -- and frankly it's encouraged! Long files can be difficult to read. 
- `README.md`
    - Motivated developers might include a README file to help document their extension. 

### Official Examples

A great to start digging into the files that make up an Extension is to check out some working examples:

- [Simple]()
- [Complex]()

## Creating UI for Extensions

To develop UI for your extension, we ask that you implement an interface that will be rendered in a [modal](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/modal-web-design#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20modal?) / pop-up.

Extension UI is implemented using the [Svelte Frontend Framework](https://svelte.dev/).

Please first make sure you've satisfied [Svelte Dependency](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate#svelte-only-if-you-are-developing-ui).

To generate a new svelte file, run the following command:

```bash
npm run add:ui <extension folder>
# For example: npm run add:ui myExtension
```

If succesful, the above command will point you to a generated file with the `.svelte` file-extension that lives inside of your extension's directory.

Feel free to change the name of this file to match it's intended usage, e.g. `Editor.svelte` or `AddItem.svelte` 

> **NOTE:** The convention is to use [Pascal Case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Pascal-case) to name svelte files, so they often start with a capital letter (unlike `.js` or `.ts` files).

### Open UI Using a Button

The most common (and recommended) way to open UI via your extension is to (1) implement a `ButtonBlock` and (2) invoke the Extension function `openUI` within the block's `operation` (which will be called when the button is clicked).

To do so, first declare a `ButtonBlock`, e.g.:

```ts
import { ButtonBlock } from "$common";

type Blocks = {
    otherBlock: () => void;
    someButton: ButtonBlock;
}

class ExampleExtension extends Extension<Details, Blocks> {
    ...
}

```

Next, implement the `ButtonBlock` definition inside of the object returned by the `defineBlocks` function. As usual, the defintion of the `ButtonBlock` is a function that returns an object containing all of the details needed to define the block. 

Most importantly, within the `operation` function of the block's definition, the function `openUI` should be invoked (which is implemented on the base `Extension` class, and can therefore be invoked using the reference to the Extension passed as the only argument to the block definition function, i.e. `self` below).

For example:
```ts
class ExampleExtension extends Extension<Details, Blocks> {
    ...
    defineBlocks(): ExampleExtension["BlockDefinitions"] {
        return {
            ...,
            someButton: (self: ExampleExtension) => ({
                type: BlockType.Button,
                text: `Button Text Goes Here`,
                operation: () => self.openUI("SvelteFileName", "Title of Window")
            })
        }
    }
}

```

The first argument is the name of the `.svelte` file in which your UI is implemented -- this name must match your filename exactly (but you can omit the `.svelte` extension).

The second argument is the title that will display at the top of the modal window. If omitted, this will default to the name of your extension.

## Testing Extensions

Writing tests is an important part of creating maintainable software. 

In addition to identifying bugs during an initial implementation or after a refactor, tests can serve to document your code and demonstrate its usage.

Extension test suites will make use of the `createTestSuite` utility function implemented in `extensions/testing/index.ts` (available under the alias `$testing`).

For example:

```ts
import { createTestSuite } from "$testing";
import Extension from '.';

createTestSuite({ Extension, __dirname },
  {
    unitTests: {
        // tests go here
    },
    integrationTests: {
        // tests go here
    }
  }
);
```

As is clear from the second argument of the `createTestSuite` function, there are two different types of tests:

### Unit Tests

Specifically for extensions, `unit tests` test the operation of a single block. 

TODO

### Integration Tests

Specifically for extensions, `integration tests` test either the operations of multiple blocks or how one extension interacts with another.

TODO

### Testing UI

The testing framework allows you to interact with UI opened by blocks under test.

TODO

## ðŸ”€ Porting an Extension to Typescript

*Want to move your vanilla-JS extension to our Typescript framework and reap the benefits of type safety and code generation?* **Great!**

Please check out the below example to get a good idea of what this would look like:

### Vanilla JS

Below is a sample, vanilla JS extension based on the final example provided in the [Scratch Extensions document](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/blob/develop/docs/extensions.md). 

What's not captured in the below example is all the additional work necessary to get the extension to show up, which includes:
- Updating [extension library jsx](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/packages/scratch-gui/src/lib/libraries/extensions/index.jsx#L71)
- Updating [extension manager](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/packages/scratch-vm/src/extension-support/extension-manager.js#L11) to support this extension 

Every step of this process is not typesafe, and thus very error prone.

```js
const ArgumentType = require('../../extension-support/argument-type');
const BlockType = require('../../extension-support/block-type');
const TargetType = require('../../extension-support/target-type');
const formatMessage = require('format-message');

class SomeBlocks {
    constructor (runtime) {
        this.runtime = runtime;
    }

    /**
     * @return {object} This extension's metadata.
     */
    getInfo () {
        return {
            id: 'someBlocks',

            // Core extensions only: override the default extension block colors.
            color1: '#FF8C1A',
            color2: '#DB6E00',
            
            name: formatMessage({
                id: 'extensionName',
                defaultMessage: 'Some Blocks',
                description: 'The name of the "Some Blocks" extension'
            }),

            blockIconURI: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAFCAAAAACyOJm3AAAAFklEQVQYV2P4DwMMEMgAI/+DEUIMBgAEWB7i7uidhAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==',

            blocks: [
                {
                    opcode: 'myReporter', 
                    blockType: BlockType.REPORTER,
                    branchCount: 0,
                    terminal: true,
                    blockAllThreads: false,
                    text: formatMessage({
                        id: 'myReporter',
                        defaultMessage: 'letter [LETTER_NUM] of [TEXT]',
                        description: 'Label on the "myReporter" block'
                    }),
                    arguments: {
                        LETTER_NUM: {
                            type: ArgumentType.NUMBER,
                            default: 1
                        },
                        TEXT: {
                            type: ArgumentType.STRING,
                            default: formatMessage({
                                id: 'myReporter.TEXT_default',
                                defaultMessage: 'text',
                                description: 'Default for "TEXT" argument of "someBlocks.myReporter"'
                            }),
                            menu: 'menuA'
                        }
                    },

                    func: 'myReporter',
                    filter: [TargetType.SPRITE]
                }
            ],
            menus: {
                menuA: [
                    {
                        value: 'itemId1',
                        text: formatMessage({
                            id: 'menuA_item1',
                            defaultMessage: 'Item One',
                            description: 'Label for item 1 of menu A in "Some Blocks" extension'
                        })
                    },
                    'itemId2'
                ]
            },
        };
    };
    
    myReporter (args) {
        const message = formatMessage({
            id: 'myReporter.result',
            defaultMessage: 'Letter {LETTER_NUM} of {TEXT} is {LETTER}.',
            description: 'The text template for the "myReporter" block result'
        });

        const result = args.TEXT.charAt(args.LETTER_NUM);

        return message.format({
            LETTER_NUM: args.LETTER_NUM,
            TEXT: args.TEXT,
            LETTER: result
        });
    };
}
```

### Typescript Extension Framework

Things to note:
- The `Details` type object encodes how the extension will be displayed in the extensions menu
    - No more editing [any jsx](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/packages/scratch-gui/src/lib/libraries/extensions/index.jsx#L71) to specify how your extension should display in the Extensions Menu
    - Now your image assets related to your extension should reside in the same place as your implementation (i.e. in the same directory as the `index.ts` file)
- Any index.ts file within a subfolder of the [extensions directory](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/scratch-vm/src/extensions) will be assumed to implement an extension
    - This means there's no need to specify your extension in the [extension-manager](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/blob/main/packages/scratch-vm/src/extension-support/extension-manager.js#L11)
- All Block text is automatically formatted for translation
    - How to actually specify these translations is coming soon! 
    - Translations for extensions are not actually supported via Scratch out of the box, so enabling this for all extensions is a win for the Typescript Framework!
- Fields not yet supported (but will be for official release):
    - [filter](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/issues/163)
    - [branchCount](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-extension-boilerplate/issues/168)

```ts
import Runtime from "$scratch-vm/engine/runtime";
import { Extension, ArgumentType, BlockType, Environment } from "$common";
import formatMessage from 'format-message';

type Details = {
  name: "Some Blocks",
  description: "A demonstration of some blocks",
  iconURL: "example.png", 
  insetIconURL: "inset.png"
};

class SomeBlocks extends Extension<Details, {
  myReporter: (text: string, letterNum: number) => string;
}> {

  runtime: Runtime;

  init(env: Environment) {
    this.runtime = env.runtime;
  }

  defineBlocks(): SomeBlocks["BlockDefinitions"] {
    return {
      myReporter: (self: SomeBlocks) => ({
        type: BlockType.Reporter,
        args: [
          { 
            type: ArgumentType.String, 
            defaultValue: 'text', 
            options: [
                { text: 'Item One', value: 'itemId1' }, 
                'itemId2'
            ] 
          },
          { type: ArgumentType.Number, defaultValue: 1 }
        ],
        text: (text, letterNum) => `letter ${letterNum} of ${text}'`,
        operation: (text, letterNum, util) => {

          const message = formatMessage({
            id: 'myReporter.result',
            default: 'Letter {letterNum} of {text} is {result}.',
            description: 'The text template for the "myReporter" block result'
          });

          const result = text.charAt(letterNum);
          
          // This doesn't actually work/compile -- perhaps the formatMessage API changed since the Scratch example was made
          return message.format({ text, letterNum, result });
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```
