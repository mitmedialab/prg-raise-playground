/** ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Below is a working Extension that you should adapt to fit your needs. 

It makes use of JSDoc comments (anything inside of the '/**   * /' regions) 
to add explanations to what you're seeing. These do not affect the code 
and can be delete when you no longer need them.

Anywhere you find something that looks like: @see {ExplanationOfSomething} 
hover over the 'ExplanationOfSomething' part to get a popup that tells you more about the code.

Try out hovering by reviewing the below terminology.
NOTE: When the documentation refers to these terms, they will be capitalized.

@see {Extension}
@see {Block}
@see {BlockProgrammingEnvironment}

If you don't see anything when hovering, or find some documentation is missing, please contact: 
Parker Malachowsky (pmalacho@media.mit.edu)

Happy coding! ðŸ‘‹ */
