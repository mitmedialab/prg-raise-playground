/**
 * The below class is responsible for implementing your extension.

 * 
 * You'll first notice that this class `extends` (or 'inherits') from the base class returned by the `extension` function.
 * 
 * Mouse over the `extension` function to get a more in-depth explanation of how it returns a base class 
 * (configured to your liking) for your class to extend / inherit from.
 * 
 * @see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#extends-clauses 
 * 
 * Next, as you'll see below, your Extension class defines Blocks in the following manner:
 * 
 * 1. Define a method on your class, which will be the functionality of your Block. 
 * @see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#methods
 * It can accept arguments of the following types:
 * @see {@link AcceptableArgumentTypes} <-- Mouse over 游내
 * It can also return a value, if you want, which will most often be one the following types: 
 * @see {@link CommonReturnTypes} <-- Mouse over 游내
 * 
 * 2. Once you have your method (what the Block does), you'll need to add some extra info to it,
 * so that the Block Programming Environment knows how to present it to the user. 
 * 
 * This requires you to "decorate" your method with the `block` function, 
 * which we do by putting an '@' symbol in front of `block` and invoking it.
 * 
 * The argument that the block function accepts provides all the information 
 * the Block Programming Environment will need, like:
 * - type: What type of block is it / how should it be used?
 * - text: What text appears on the block? 
 * - arg or args: How should the method's arguments map to input fields?
