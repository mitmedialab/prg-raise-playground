       * 
       * Typescript will ensure that the types of the old & new block match, along with their arguemnts.
       * Typescript will also ensure that, if an argument previously used a 'menu', 
       * then an 'options' value must be provided when defining the corresponding arg / args entry.
       * 
       * At runtime, this function will attach legacy 'names' to the blocks, their arguments, and their menus 
       * to ensure old saved projects can interop with our new extension.
       * 
       * Also, at runtime, the 'options' values will be compared against the values in their corresponding 'menu' 
       * (if the menu was provided in the object given to the 'extractLegacySupportFromOldGetInfo' function).
       * An error will be thrown if they don't match, so make sure to check the Console in your browser.
