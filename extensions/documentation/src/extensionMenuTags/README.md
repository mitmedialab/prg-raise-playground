## Extension Menu Tags / Categories

Extensions can be associated with certain `tags` (or categories), which are visible in the [Extensions Menu](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Extension#Adding_Extensions) and allow users to more easily find the extensions they are looking for.

`tags` are be specified within the first "details" argument of the `extension(...)` factory function invocation, like so:

[](./index.ts)

To add define new `tags`, add an additional string literal to the [Tag type]().
